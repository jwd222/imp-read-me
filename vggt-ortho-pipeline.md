### Generating True Orthophotos with VGGt and Vexcel: A Look at the Possibilities

**It is plausible that Meta AI's Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGt) could be a valuable tool in the workflow for generating true orthophotos from Vexcel camera imagery, particularly when dealing with approximate initial camera parameters. However, it is unlikely to be a complete one-click solution and would likely require integration with traditional photogrammetric software for the highest accuracy results.**

VGGt is a powerful AI model capable of rapidly predicting 3D attributes of a scene, including camera positions (extrinsics), intrinsic camera parameters, and depth maps, from a collection of images. This technology has shown remarkable speed and accuracy, in some cases surpassing traditional methods that require extensive post-processing.

True orthophoto generation, a staple in fields like urban planning and environmental monitoring, is a meticulous process. It demands highly accurate camera orientation data and a detailed Digital Surface Model (DSM) to correct for image distortions and occlusions caused by terrain and buildings.

Here's a breakdown of how VGGt could fit into the true orthophoto generation workflow with Vexcel camera data:

#### The Potential Role of VGGt

1.  **Rapid Initial Parameter Estimation:** VGGt's key strength lies in its ability to quickly predict camera parameters from the images themselves. Given a set of Vexcel images with "approximate" camera extrinsics and intrinsics, VGGt could potentially refine these initial estimates to a higher degree of accuracy in a fraction of the time required by traditional methods.

2.  **Depth Map to DSM Generation:** The depth maps generated by VGGt for each image can be used to create a 3D point cloud of the scene. This point cloud can then be converted into a Digital Surface Model (DSM), which is a critical component for true orthophoto generation as it provides the necessary elevation data to correct for occlusions. The quality of the VGGt-derived DSM would be a crucial factor in the final orthophoto's accuracy.

3.  **Accelerating the Workflow:** By automating the initial, often time-consuming, steps of camera parameter estimation and DSM creation, VGGt could significantly accelerate the overall true orthophoto production pipeline.

#### Considerations and Caveats

While the potential is significant, several factors need to be considered:

*   **Accuracy Requirements:** True orthophoto generation for professional applications often requires survey-grade accuracy. While VGGt's predictions are described as "highly accurate," it is not yet definitively established that this accuracy meets the stringent standards of traditional photogrammetric workflows that rely on ground control points and rigorous bundle adjustments. It is more likely that the output from VGGt would serve as a very strong starting point for further refinement in photogrammetric software.
*   **Vexcel's Existing Ecosystem:** Vexcel is a leading manufacturer of high-end aerial cameras and provides its own sophisticated software suite, such as UltraMap, for processing their imagery. This software is specifically designed to work with the rich data from their cameras to produce highly accurate DSMs and true orthophotos. Therefore, any workflow involving VGGt would need to demonstrate a clear advantage in terms of speed or cost over these established, highly integrated systems.
*   **The "Approximate" Nature of Input Data:** The quality of the initial "approximate" camera parameters can influence the final accuracy of VGGt's output. While VGGt can predict these parameters from scratch, providing it with a reasonable starting point can help in achieving a more refined and accurate result.

#### A Possible Workflow

A hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both VGGt and traditional methods could look like this:

1.  **Initial Processing with VGGt:** Feed the Vexcel camera images and their approximate camera parameters into the VGGt model.
2.  **Generate Outputs:** Obtain the refined camera extrinsics and intrinsics, as well as the per-image depth maps from VGGt.
3.  **Create a DSM:** Convert the VGGt-generated depth maps into a dense 3D point cloud and subsequently create a high-resolution DSM.
4.  **Refinement and Orthorectification:** Import the VGGt-derived camera parameters and the DSM into a professional photogrammetric software package. Here, a final bundle adjustment, potentially with a small number of ground control points, could be performed to ensure the highest level of accuracy. The software would then use this highly accurate data to perform the orthorectification.
5.  **Mosaicking:** The final step would involve mosaicking the individual orthorectified images, ensuring seamless transitions and filling in any occluded areas to create the final true orthophoto.

Implementing the first three steps of the proposed workflow to generate a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from Vexcel imagery using Meta AI's VGGt is a multi-stage process that involves setting up the environment, preparing the data, running the AI model, and processing its output.

Hereâ€™s a detailed, step-by-step guide to accomplish this, based on publicly available information about VGGt.

### **Prerequisites: Setting Up Your Environment**

Before you begin, you'll need a suitable environment to run the VGGt model. This typically involves a powerful computer with a high-end NVIDIA GPU, as VGGt is a large model.

1.  **Install Python:** Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed. The VGGt documentation should specify the recommended version. It has been noted that using Python 3.12 or older may be necessary due to potential issues with newer versions and PyTorch dependencies.
2.  **Clone the VGGt Repository:** The VGGt model, code, and documentation are publicly available on GitHub. You will need to clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt.git
    cd vggt
    ```
3.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system's Python installation.

    ```bash
    python -m venv vggt-env
    source vggt-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `vggt-env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies:** The VGGt repository includes a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary Python libraries. Install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    For running interactive demos, there might be an additional requirements file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_demo.txt
    ```
5.  **Automatic Model Download:** The first time you run a script that uses the VGGt model, the pre-trained model weights will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face. This can be a large download, so ensure you have a stable internet connection.

### **Step 1: Initial Processing with VGGt**

This step involves preparing your Vexcel camera images and their approximate parameters to feed into the VGGt model.

1.  **Organize Your Vexcel Images:** Place all the Vexcel images you want to process into a single folder. VGGt can process one, a few, or even hundreds of images at once. The model can handle various image formats that are readable by standard libraries like Pillow.

2.  **Prepare Approximate Camera Parameters (if available):** VGGt can predict camera parameters from scratch. However, if you have approximate extrinsics (position and orientation) and intrinsics (focal length, principal point) from your Vexcel system's GPS/IMU data, you can potentially use them. The VGGt architecture incorporates "camera tokens" as part of its input. You will need to format your camera data to match the expected input format for these tokens. Refer to the VGGt documentation and example scripts to understand the precise data structure for providing initial camera parameters. If this is not straightforward, you can proceed without providing them and let VGGt perform the estimation from the images alone.

3.  **Run the VGGt Model:** The VGGt GitHub repository provides scripts to run the model. A key script to use would be one that takes a folder of images as input and saves the predictions. A recently added script, `demo_colmap.py`, is particularly useful as it can save the outputs in the COLMAP format, which is widely used in 3D reconstruction.

    You can run the model using a command similar to this, pointing to your image folder:
    ```bash
    python demo_colmap.py --image_dir /path/to/your/vexcel_images --output_dir /path/to/output
    ```
    This script will process the images and save the predicted camera parameters and other data. For more detailed usage and options, refer to the provided demo scripts. The model can output camera parameters, depth maps, and point maps for all images in a single forward pass.

### **Step 2: Generate Outputs (Refined Parameters and Depth Maps)**

After running the VGGt model, the specified output directory will contain the results. The key outputs for our workflow are the refined camera parameters and the per-image depth maps.

1.  **Refined Camera Parameters:** VGGt will output the estimated camera extrinsics and intrinsics for each input image. If you used a script like `demo_colmap.py`, these will be saved in a format compatible with COLMAP. These parameters are a more accurate representation of the camera's state than the initial approximate values.

2.  **Depth Maps:** VGGt also generates a depth map for each input image. A depth map is a grayscale image where the intensity of each pixel corresponds to its distance from the camera. These depth maps are crucial for creating the 3D point cloud. The model has a specific "DPT head" for generating dense outputs like depth maps.

### **Step 3: Create a Digital Surface Model (DSM)**

This step involves converting the depth maps and camera parameters into a 3D point cloud and then into a DSM.

1.  **From Depth Maps to Point Cloud:** Each pixel in a depth map can be projected into 3D space using the corresponding camera's refined intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. This process, often called "back-projection," will create a 3D point cloud for each image.

    You can achieve this using a custom script or a library that supports this functionality. The basic principle for each pixel `(u, v)` with depth `d` is:
    *   Convert the 2D pixel coordinate `(u, v)` to a normalized 3D ray in the camera's coordinate system using the intrinsic parameters.
    *   Scale this ray by the depth value `d` to get the 3D point in the camera's coordinate system.
    *   Transform this 3D point into the world coordinate system using the extrinsic parameters (rotation and translation).

    By iterating through all pixels in all depth maps, you can generate a dense point cloud of the entire scene. The VGGt project provides visualization scripts that can generate point clouds from either the depth maps or the direct point map predictions.

2.  **Merging Point Clouds:** The point clouds generated from each image will need to be merged into a single, cohesive point cloud representing the entire area captured by the Vexcel images.

3.  **Point Cloud to DSM:** Once you have the final, dense point cloud, you can convert it into a Digital Surface Model. A DSM is a 2.5D raster grid where each cell value represents the elevation of the surface at that location. This can be done using various photogrammetry and GIS software or libraries (e.g., CloudCompare, PDAL, or Python libraries like `laspy` and `rasterio`). The general process involves:
    *   Optionally, cleaning the point cloud to remove noise or outliers.
    *   Creating a regular grid over the extent of the point cloud.
    *   For each grid cell, determining the elevation from the points that fall within that cell. A common method is to use the highest point's elevation, which is characteristic of a DSM.

After completing these three steps, you will have a DSM and the refined camera parameters, which are the necessary inputs for the subsequent steps of orthorectification and mosaicking that you can already manage.
